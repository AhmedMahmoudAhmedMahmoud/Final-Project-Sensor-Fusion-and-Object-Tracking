# SDCND : Sensor Fusion and Tracking
This is the project for the second course in the  [Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213) : Sensor Fusion and Tracking. 

In this project, you'll fuse measurements from LiDAR and camera and track vehicles over time. You will be using real-world data from the Waymo Open Dataset, detect objects in 3D point clouds and apply an extended Kalman filter for sensor fusion and tracking.

The project consists of two major parts: 
1. **Object detection**: In this part, a deep-learning approach is used to detect vehicles in LiDAR data based on a birds-eye view perspective of the 3D point-cloud. Also, a series of performance measures is used to evaluate the performance of the detection approach. 
2. **Object tracking** : In this part, an extended Kalman filter is used to track vehicles over time, based on the lidar detections fused with camera detections. Data association and track management are implemented as well.

The following diagram contains an outline of the data flow and of the individual steps that make up the algorithm.

Also, the project code contains various tasks, which are detailed step-by-step in the code. More information on the algorithm and on the tasks can be found in the Udacity classroom.

## Installation Instructions for Running Locally
### Cloning the Project
In order to create a local copy of the project, please click on "Code" and then "Download ZIP". Alternatively, you may of-course use GitHub Desktop or Git Bash for this purpose. 

### Python
The project has been written using Python 3.7. Please make sure that your local installation is equal or above this version. 

### Package Requirements
All dependencies required for the project have been listed in the file `requirements.txt`. You may either install them one-by-one using pip or you can use the following command to install them all at once: 
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt` 

### Waymo Open Dataset Reader
The Waymo Open Dataset Reader is a very convenient toolbox that allows you to access sequences from the Waymo Open Dataset without the need of installing all of the heavy-weight dependencies that come along with the official toolbox. The installation instructions can be found in `tools/waymo_reader/README.md`. 

### Waymo Open Dataset Files
This project makes use of three different sequences to illustrate the concepts of object detection and tracking. These are: 
- Sequence 1 : `training_segment-1005081002024129653_5313_150_5333_150_with_camera_labels.tfrecord`
- Sequence 2 : `training_segment-10072231702153043603_5725_000_5745_000_with_camera_labels.tfrecord`
- Sequence 3 : `training_segment-10963653239323173269_1924_000_1944_000_with_camera_labels.tfrecord`

To download these files, you will have to register with Waymo Open Dataset first: [Open Dataset – Waymo](https://waymo.com/open/terms), if you have not already, making sure to note "Udacity" as your institution.

Once you have done so, please [click here](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/waymo_open_dataset_v_1_2_0_individual_files) to access the Google Cloud Container that holds all the sequences. Once you have been cleared for access by Waymo (which might take up to 48 hours), you can download the individual sequences. 

The sequences listed above can be found in the folder "training". Please download them and put the `tfrecord`-files into the `dataset` folder of this project.


### Pre-Trained Models
The object detection methods used in this project use pre-trained models which have been provided by the original authors. They can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Pqx7sShlqKSGmvshTYbNDcUEYyZwfn3A/view?usp=sharing) (darknet) and [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RcEfUIF1pzDZco8PJkZ10OL-wLL2usEj/view?usp=sharing) (fpn_resnet). Once downloaded, please copy the model files into the paths `/tools/objdet_models/darknet/pretrained` and `/tools/objdet_models/fpn_resnet/pretrained` respectively.

### Using Pre-Computed Results

In the main file `loop_over_dataset.py`, you can choose which steps of the algorithm should be executed. If you want to call a specific function, you simply need to add the corresponding string literal to one of the following lists: 

- `exec_data` : controls the execution of steps related to sensor data. 
  - `pcl_from_rangeimage` transforms the Waymo Open Data range image into a 3D point-cloud
  - `load_image` returns the image of the front camera

- `exec_detection` : controls which steps of model-based 3D object detection are performed
  - `bev_from_pcl` transforms the point-cloud into a fixed-size birds-eye view perspective
  - `detect_objects` executes the actual detection and returns a set of objects (only vehicles) 
  - `validate_object_labels` decides which ground-truth labels should be considered (e.g. based on difficulty or visibility)
  - `measure_detection_performance` contains methods to evaluate detection performance for a single frame

In case you do not include a specific step into the list, pre-computed binary files will be loaded instead. This enables you to run the algorithm and look at the results even without having implemented anything yet. The pre-computed results for the mid-term project need to be loaded using [this](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-s46dKSrtx8rrNwnObGbly2nO3i4D7r7?usp=sharing) link. Please use the folder `darknet` first. Unzip the file within and put its content into the folder `results`.

- `exec_tracking` : controls the execution of the object tracking algorithm

- `exec_visualization` : controls the visualization of results
  - `show_range_image` displays two LiDAR range image channels (range and intensity)
  - `show_labels_in_image` projects ground-truth boxes into the front camera image
  - `show_objects_and_labels_in_bev` projects detected objects and label boxes into the birds-eye view
  - `show_objects_in_bev_labels_in_camera` displays a stacked view with labels inside the camera image on top and the birds-eye view with detected objects on the bottom
  - `show_tracks` displays the tracking results
  - `show_detection_performance` displays the performance evaluation based on all detected 
  - `make_tracking_movie` renders an output movie of the object tracking results

Even without solving any of the tasks, the project code can be executed. 

The final project uses pre-computed lidar detections in order for all students to have the same input data. If you use the workspace, the data is prepared there already. Otherwise, [download the pre-computed lidar detections](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IkqFGYTF6Fh_d8J3UjQOSNJ2V42UDZpO?usp=sharing) (~1 GB), unzip them and put them in the folder `results`.

## Step 1
Implementing Extended Kalman Filter to track a single real-world target

The F function returns the system matrix F, which describes the state transition from one time step to the next. The Q function returns the process noise covariance Q

The predict function takes a track object and predicts the state and estimation error covariance to the next time step

Theupdate function takes a track object and a measurement object, and updates the state and covariance with the associated measurement.

The gamma function calculates and returns the residual gamma, which is the difference between the measured and predicted states

 The S function calculates and returns the covariance of the residual.

## Step 2
Implementing the track management to initialize and delete tracks, set a track state and a track score.

Defined two classes: Track and Trackmanagement

The Track class is a simple class that stores information about a single object track. It has state vector (x), covariance matrix (P), track ID (id), track score (score),  time stamp (t)
The Trackmanagement class is a class for managing the tracks, it has  It has a list of tracks(track_list) , current number of tracks (N)

## Step 3
 Implementing a single nearest neighbor data association to associate measurements to tracks
 
 The meas_list is a list of measurements that are currently being received.
 The method calculates the Mahalanobis distance between each track and each measurement and updates the association_matrix
 The get_closest_track_and_meas method finds the indices of the track and the measurement that have the smallest Mahalanobis distance in the association_matrix
 The gating method takes two arguments: MHD and sensor. MHD is the Mahalanobis distance between a track and a measurement.
 The MHD method takes three arguments: track, meas, and KF
 The associate_and_update method takes three arguments: manager, meas_list, and KF. The manager is an object that manages the tracks
